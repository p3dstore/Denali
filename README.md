# Denali - Alpha 1
Project Denali is a CoreXY, Moving Bed, Medium Size, Bowden Drive, FDM Printer

This can be considered a fork of both the VORON1 and VORON2 Projects, and is a FORK of the V2 gantry, with some rethought parts, and with a brand new kinematic ballscrew driven bed leveling system, enclosure and electronics bay.

The main goal was to reduce complexity, while providing a fast reliable and ultimately simpler printer.

It is not in any way affiliated with VORON Design.
